In Again.py file user can easily scrap data for single tables of particular teams. Initially the link has been set up for League-1 2019-20 season that can be easily changed.

In Merged.py an effort has been made to merge all the tables of particular team as one table. So, that ultimately all the tables will be merged in final 20 tables for whole season. Which will be easy to understand and analyse.
